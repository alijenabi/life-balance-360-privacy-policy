# Privacy Policy

Last updated: June 2, 2023

## Overview

This Privacy Policy outlines the types of information that we gather about you while you are using the Life Balance 360 app, as well as the ways in which we safeguard that information. This policy applies only to our app, and we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of any other apps or websites.

By downloading, installing, and using this app, you accept the practices described in this Privacy Policy.

## Information We Collect

Our app is designed to prioritize your privacy. To that end:

1. **Local Data Storage**: We only store user data locally on your device. The data stored includes personal settings, user-generated content, etc.

2. **Data Removal**: We provide users with the ability to remove their data at any point in time. Users can achieve this by navigating to the settings section of the app and tapping on the "Reset Factory" option.

## How We Use Your Information

**Data Not Shared or Analysed**: We do not share, distribute, or analyse the data stored on your device in any way. Your data remains entirely within your control, on your device, unless you choose to remove it.

## Data Security

We prioritize protecting the data you store on our app. However, it's important to note that the app does not connect to the internet or any other type of network, thereby further reducing any potential risks associated with data transmission.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page, and the date at the top of this Privacy Policy will be updated. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
